## TFG: Modelling  and simulation for zoonoses

# MATLAB simulation of leptospirosis

An epidemiological SI-SAIRD model is developed to simulate the propagation of leptospirosis, taking
into account the interaction between humans and domestic animals. The model
describes different modes of disease transmission and estimates parameters to simulate
contagion dynamics in everyday scenarios, such as beaches and park taking different measures in order 
to determine important infection behaviours.
